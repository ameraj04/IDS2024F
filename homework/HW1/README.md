1. This is not a question.

3. Name the three historical types of Version Control Systems.
   a. Local Vision Control System
   b. Centralized Vision Control System
   c. Distributed Vision Control System
4. The best type of control vision system is Distributed. Due to cloning of the data at individual level, data cannot be lost. Consequently, if the repository fails by any means, the local repository of any individual who has the most recent clone of the project database can restore the central repository.
5. Commands:
   a . git pull - pulls the latest changes from the server to local copy of the project.
   b.  git status - checks the status of the project.
   c.  git add --all - adds any of the modified files or newly created files.
   d.  git commit'm' latest build - automatically stages and commits the files together.
   e.  git push --all - pushes all commits from the local repository to the remote repository, to place them permanently there so that they can be shared to others.
 6. Part a,b and c are done.
