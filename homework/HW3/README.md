The Three Pillars of Science are: Experiment, Theory and Computation.   
Three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences are: a. Bioinformatics/Genomics/Genetics: Computational and Data Sciences can help with the collection and analyzation of data about DNA sequences, etc to understand the molecular structures. b. Healthcare & Medical Imaging: Machine algorithms and models can help with the medical imagings such as MRI, CT scans etc to study the trend of disease and optimize the treatment.  c. Astronomy & Astrophysics: Computational models and techniques assist with data collection of telescopes and space stuff such as formation of galaxies, etc.   
The two types of scientific reasonings are: a. Deductive: This type of reasoning is a statement that can be either true or false. It has to be one only and cannot be both. Premise 1: All fruits contrain seeds. Premise 2: An apple is a fruit. Conclusion: Therefore, an apple is a fruit.  b. Plausible: When conclusions are reached using data or observations that point to a likely or probable outcome rather than offering complete assurance, this is known as plausible reasoning. It entails drawing conclusions or generalizations from particular cases, experiences, or trends; these conclusions are plausible and reasonable, but they are not always accurate. Plausible reasoning addresses uncertainty and seeks to determine the most likely or reasonable answer given the evidence at hand, in contrast to deductive reasoning, which provides logically certain conclusions.                                         Observation 1: I usually eats a salad for lunch on weekdays. Observation 2: Today is a weekday. Conclusion: I will probably eat a salad for lunch today.    

The three stages of scientific inference in the prediction pyramid are: Prediction Scenario , Validation Scenario and Caliberation Scenario.
