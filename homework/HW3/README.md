The Three Pillars of Science are: Experiment, Theory and Computation.   
Three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences are: a. Bioinformatics/Genomics/Genetics: Computational and Data Sciences can help with the collection and analyzation of data about DNA sequences, etc to understand the molecular structures. b. Healthcare & Medical Imaging: Machine algorithms and models can help with the medical imagings such as MRI, CT scans etc to study the trend of disease and optimize the treatment.  c. Astronomy & Astrophysics: Computational models and techniques assist with data collection of telescopes and space stuff such as formation of galaxies, etc.   
The two types of scientific reasonings are: a. Deductive: This type of reasoning is a statement that can be either true or false. It has to be one only and cannot be both. Premise 1: All fruits contrain seeds. Premise 2: An apple is a fruit. Conclusion: Therefore, an apple is a fruit.  b. Plausible: When conclusions are reached using data or observations that point to a likely or probable outcome rather than offering complete assurance, this is known as plausible reasoning. It entails drawing conclusions or generalizations from particular cases, experiences, or trends; these conclusions are plausible and reasonable, but they are not always accurate. Plausible reasoning addresses uncertainty and seeks to determine the most likely or reasonable answer given the evidence at hand, in contrast to deductive reasoning, which provides logically certain conclusions.                                         Observation 1: I usually eats a salad for lunch on weekdays. Observation 2: Today is a weekday. Conclusion: I will probably eat a salad for lunch today.    
Reality is a natural phenomena. It is independent of any measurements or observations. Often reality is vast and complexed, it gets challenging to be measured or observed. Observational Data is information that is collected through measurements, observations, etc. Observational data can be influenced by factors such as limited use of tool/technology, bias in data or measurement errors whereas, reality is not affected by these limitations. Interpreting observational data is frequently necessary to determine what it suggests about reality. Different interpretations can arise from the same data, while reality remains constant. In essence, observational data is an approximation or a model of reality, rather than a perfect representation. It can help us understand aspects of reality, but it is always subject to limitations and uncertainties.   
The three stages of scientific inference in the prediction pyramid are: Prediction Scenario , Validation Scenario and Caliberation Scenario. 
A statement or assertion that is either true or false, but not both, is called a logical proposition. It is a declarative phrase with a clear truth value (true or false) that states a fact or a claim about the world. Propositions are the fundamental units of logic that underpin more intricate expressions and reasoning. A proposition must be clear and unambiguous, meaning it should be possible to determine whether it is true or false without interpretation. Examples: "2,4,6,8 are even numbers." (True)      ,     "Fish can fly." (False).    

No, A⇒B does not necessitate B⇒A. This relationship is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent in logical reasoning, which mistakenly assumes that if the consequence is true, then the antecedent must also be true. Example: Let AA be "I am in Karachi." Let BB be "I am in Pakistan." The implication A⇒B can be interpreted as: "If I am in Karachi, then I am in Pakistan." This statement makes sense because Karachi is located in Pakistan. However, the reverse implication B⇒A as: "If I am in Pakistan, then I am in Karachi") is not necessarily true. Because if I am in Pakistan, I can be in any other city such as Lahore, Islamabad. Therefore, while A⇒B holds, B⇒A does not automatically follow. This example demonstrates that the truth of BB does not guarantee the truth of AA, even if A⇒B is valid.  
The Venn diagram above represents the logical sum or disjunction A+B. The shaded regions include the area where A is true, the area where B is true, and the area where both A and B are true. This indicates that A+B is true if at least one of the propositions A or B is true, or if both are true.  
The Venn diagram above represents the logical product or conjunction A.B. The shaded region corresponds to the intersection where both A and B are true. This indicates that A.B is true only when both propositions A and B are true simultaneously. If either A or B (or both) is false, the conjunction is false.
