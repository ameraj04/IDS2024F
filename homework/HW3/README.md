The Three Pillars of Science are: Experiment, Theory and Computation/Simulation. 

Three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences are: a. Bioinformatics/Genomics/Genetics: Computational and Data Sciences can help with the collection and analyzation of data about DNA sequences, etc to understand the molecular structures. b. Healthcare & Medical Imaging: Machine algorithms and models can help with the medical imagings such as MRI, CT scans etc to study the trend of disease and optimize the treatment.  c. Astronomy & Astrophysics: Computational models and techniques assist with data collection of telescopes and space stuff such as formation of galaxies, etc.   

The two types of scientific reasonings are: a. Deductive: This type of reasoning is a statement that can be either true or false. It has to be one only and cannot be both. Premise 1: All fruits contrain seeds. Premise 2: An apple is a fruit. Conclusion: Therefore, an apple is a fruit.  b. Plausible: When conclusions are reached using data or observations that point to a likely or probable outcome rather than offering complete assurance, this is known as plausible reasoning. It entails drawing conclusions or generalizations from particular cases, experiences, or trends; these conclusions are plausible and reasonable, but they are not always accurate. Plausible reasoning addresses uncertainty and seeks to determine the most likely or reasonable answer given the evidence at hand, in contrast to deductive reasoning, which provides logically certain conclusions.                                         Observation 1: I usually eats a salad for lunch on weekdays. Observation 2: Today is a weekday. Conclusion: I will probably eat a salad for lunch today. 

Reality is a natural phenomena. It is independent of any measurements or observations. Often reality is vast and complexed, it gets challenging to be measured or observed. Observational Data is information that is collected through measurements, observations, etc. Observational data can be influenced by factors such as limited use of tool/technology, bias in data or measurement errors whereas, reality is not affected by these limitations. Interpreting observational data is frequently necessary to determine what it suggests about reality. Different interpretations can arise from the same data, while reality remains constant. In essence, observational data is an approximation or a model of reality, rather than a perfect representation. It can help us understand aspects of reality, but it is always subject to limitations and uncertainties. 

The three stages of scientific inference in the prediction pyramid are: Prediction Scenario , Validation Scenario and Caliberation Scenario. 

A statement or assertion that is either true or false, but not both, is called a logical proposition. It is a declarative phrase with a clear truth value (true or false) that states a fact or a claim about the world. Propositions are the fundamental units of logic that underpin more intricate expressions and reasoning. A proposition must be clear and unambiguous, meaning it should be possible to determine whether it is true or false without interpretation. Examples: "2,4,6,8 are even numbers." (True)      ,     "Fish can fly." (False).    

In deductive reasoning, a logical proposition cannot be simultaneously both true and false; this is a fundamental principle known as the law of non-contradiction. In deductive reasoning, if a proposition is true, then it cannot be false, and if it is false, it cannot be true. Also, the truth value of a proposition must be consistent, which is essential for forming valid logical conclusions.
Example: Consider the logical proposition R: "The car is parked in the garage."
Case 1: R is true. If the car is indeed parked in the garage, then the proposition R is true.
Case 2: R is false. If the car is not parked in the garage (for example, it is on the street or in another location), then the proposition R is false.
If R is true (the car is parked in the garage), then it cannot also be false (the car is not parked in the garage). Conversely, if R is false (the car is not in the garage), it cannot also be true (the car is indeed parked in the garage).

No, A⇒B does not necessitate B⇒A. This relationship is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent in logical reasoning, which mistakenly assumes that if the consequence is true, then the antecedent must also be true. Example: Let A be "I am in Karachi." Let B be "I am in Pakistan." The implication A⇒B can be interpreted as: "If I am in Karachi, then I am in Pakistan." This statement makes sense because Karachi is located in Pakistan. However, the reverse implication B⇒A as: "If I am in Pakistan, then I am in Karachi") is not necessarily true. Because if I am in Pakistan, I can be in any other city such as Lahore, Islamabad. Therefore, while A⇒B holds, B⇒A does not automatically follow. This example demonstrates that the truth of B does not guarantee the truth of A, even if A⇒B is valid.  

The Venn diagram above represents the logical sum or disjunction A+B. The shaded regions include the area where A is true, the area where B is true, and the area where both A and B are true. This indicates that A+B is true if at least one of the propositions A or B is true, or if both are true.  

The Venn diagram above represents the logical product or conjunction A.B. The shaded region corresponds to the intersection where both A and B are true. This indicates that A.B is true only when both propositions A and B are true simultaneously. If either A or B (or both) is false, the conjunction is false.    


"Let A be "The alarm goes off." "Let B be "It is 9 AM."  The logical implication A⇒B can be interpreted as: "If the alarm goes off, then it is 7 AM." This might be a true statement in some contexts (e.g., if the alarm is set to go off at 7 AM), but it does not mean that the act of the alarm going off causes the time to be 7 AM. In this case, while the implication holds true if the alarm goes off at 7 AM, it does not mean that the alarm itself is responsible for the time being 7 AM. The alarm is just a signal indicating that it is time; the actual passage of time is an independent process. This example demonstrates that logical implications can exist without establishing a causal relationship between the two statements. The relationship may hold true logically, but it does not imply that one event causes the other in a physical sense.  

Propositions:
Let A: "The gentleman is a burglar."
Let B: "The window of the jewelry store is broken."
Let C: "The burglar alarm is sounding."
Let D: "The gentleman is carrying stolen jewelry."
Reasoning Process: Premise 1: If the window of the jewelry store is broken, then it is likely that a burglary has occurred. This can be written as: B⇒A (If the window is broken, then the gentleman is likely a burglar.) Premise 2: If the burglar alarm is sounding, then it indicates that someone is attempting to commit a burglary.This can be written as: C⇒A(If the burglar alarm is sounding, then the gentleman is likely a burglar.) Premise 3: If the gentleman is a burglar, then he is likely carrying stolen jewelry. This can be written as: A⇒D(If the gentleman is a burglar, then he is carrying stolen jewelry.)
Putting It All Together: From the observations, the policeman can logically deduce the following: Observation: The window is broken (B) and the burglar alarm is sounding (C). Conclusion 1: Based on B⇒A and C⇒A, the policeman concludes: (B∨C)⇒A(If the window is broken or the alarm is sounding, then the gentleman is likely a burglar.)
Conclusion 2: Given that he believes AA (the gentleman is a burglar) is true, he concludes that: A⇒D(If the gentleman is a burglar, then he is carrying stolen jewelry.)
Final Conclusion: The policeman concludes that: The gentleman is a burglar (A). Therefore, he is carrying stolen jewelry (D). This reasoning shows how the policeman arrives at the conclusion based on the given observations and logical deductions without specifically linking physical causation. 

a. The tiniest unit of information is Bit. A bit of information can either represent 0 or 1.   
b. It represents the most basic form of information, a yes/no or true/false situation. This allows it to convey fundamental decisions or states.
Inductive Logic with Examples: Single Dot in Space:
Me being the dot can be represented by a single bit, indicating my presence (1) or absence (0). This bit of information is the most basic representation of my existence.
Determining Coordinates: To identify coordinates, I require more information than just being existing as a dot. For example, in a 2D space, I need two bits of information to specify its position: one bit for the x-coordinate and another for the y-coordinate. But in a 3D space, I need three bits (one for each axis: x, y, and z). 
Movement and Speed: If the dot (I) am moving, I need more information to determine motion. For instance: The direction of movement (which could require multiple bits depending on the directions). The speed (which also requires additional bits to define the magnitude of the speed).
Conclusion: Because bit is the basic building block from which more sophisticated information can be created, a bit is the smallest unit of information. Extra bits are required to convey extra context and detail, such as position, movement, and speed, even though a single bit can indicate the most fundamental yes/no or on/off state. Building up from the most basic state, each additional bit enables us to express information that is more intricate and subtle.   
c. 1. Collection of 1 Box (1 Bit):
Each box (bit) can have 2 possible states: 0 or 1.
Therefore, with 1 box, the number of different things we can represent is:
2^1=2
Possible representations: {0, 1}.
2. Collection of 2 Boxes (2 Bits):
Each of the 2 boxes can also have 2 possible states (0 or 1).
Therefore, with 2 boxes, the number of different things we can represent is:
2^2=4
Possible representations: {00, 01, 10, 11}.
3. Collection of 3 Boxes (3 Bits):
Each of the 3 boxes can have 2 possible states.
Therefore, with 3 boxes, the number of different things we can represent is:
2^3=8
Possible representations: {000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111}.
Therefore,
With 1 box: 2 different representations, with 2 boxes: 4 different representations and With 3 boxes: 8 different representations.
