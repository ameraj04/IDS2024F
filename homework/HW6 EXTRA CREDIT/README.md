Question 1.  
Done 2. Done 3. Done 4. 4. Prediction for 2050 from Quadratic Model: The temperature anomaly for 2050 is predicted to be approximately: y=1.57∘C
This means that, relative to the baseline (likely the pre-industrial period), the Earth's temperature will be +1.57°C higher by 2050.
This result is more realistic compared to the predictions from the simple linear. Climate models from institutions like the IPCC also project a warming of 1.5°C to 2°C by 2050 under moderate emissions scenarios, so this fits with global climate science predictions.
Prediction for 2050 from Linear Model:
•	Assumes constant warming: The temperature anomaly increases at a constant rate each year.
•	Simpler model: Easier to calculate and interpret.
•	Prediction for 2050:
o	From the previous calculation, the predicted anomaly for 2050 was approximately: y=0.816∘C
o	This means the temperature anomaly will be +0.816°C relative to the baseline.
Reality Check:
•	Limitation: Climate change is rarely linear. Evidence suggests that the rate of temperature increase is accelerating, so a constant rate of warming may underestimate future warming.
•	Good fit? A linear model is a good first step, but it may not fully capture the accelerating trend of global warming.
Conclusion:
 Better Model: Quadratic Model
| Prediction for 2050: +1.57°C
•	The quadratic model fits reality better because climate change is accelerating, not linear.
•	Its prediction for 2050 (+1.57°C) is consistent with forecasts from leading climate science organizations (like the IPCC).
•	The simple linear model predicts only +0.816°C, which underestimates future warming.  
Quadratic Model predicts more temperature increase in the future.   
Question 2.  
a. The two free parameters of the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm are:
1.	Epsilon (ε): The maximum distance between two points to be considered part of the same cluster.
2.	MinPts: The minimum number of points required to form a dense region (core point) that can start a cluster.
b. No, these parameters are not unique.
•	You can achieve a single cluster with different combinations of ε\varepsilonε and MinPts.
•	Increasing ε\varepsilonε and decreasing MinPts will still merge all points into a single cluster.
•	Decreasing MinPts to 1 always guarantees that points will be classified as core points, and with a large enough ε\varepsilonε, you will have one large cluster.
I can use dmax/2 as epsilon and 2 minpts. 
c. Done.  
Question 3.  
a. Done. b. Done. c. Done. d. Done. e. Yes, it is satisfying. It is very close to how I wanted to do it.  f. Done.  g. Done. 
h. No, it does not look the same. Because in Manual Placement if you place points using parametric equations (like circles and parabolas), the points will be evenly spaced and symmetrical. But in Random Placement If you randomly distribute points around face, the distribution will be more "natural" but less symmetrical. The clusters look different because randomness and algorithmic decisions affected the output. Random placement often leads to uneven point density, which affects clustering algorithms. Clustering algorithms are influenced by initialization, convergence criteria, and randomness. i. Done.  
1. Non-spherical Clusters: The smiley face is composed of circles and arcs, not blobs. DBSCAN handles arbitrary shapes, while K-means only works with "blob-like" clusters.
2.  Noise Handling: DBSCAN ignores background points as noise, but K-means tries to assign every point to a cluster.
3. No Predefined Clusters: DBSCAN doesn't require you to set the number of clusters kkk, whereas K-means forces you to guess kkk beforehand.
4. Arbitrary Shapes: The circular eyes, curved smile, and round face outline can be captured by DBSCAN but not by K-means.
5. Deterministic Output: DBSCAN produces consistent results, while K-means depends on random initialization.  
Question 4.  
The plot uses the following axes:
1.	X-axis (horizontal): This axis likely represents a linear scale, as the increments appear uniform.
2.	Y-axis (vertical): The y-axis also appears to be on a linear scale, with uniform increments shown for the dependent variable.
Mathematical Functions for the Two Phases:
1.	Initial (Seemingly Linear) Phase: The initial portions of the curves (blue, yellow, and red) seem to follow a linear relationship, where the dependent variable (y) increases proportionally with the independent variable (x).
2.	Second (Non-linear) Phase: The second phase of the curves exhibits saturation behavior. This phase typically arises in systems where growth or response starts to level off due to constraints or limiting factors. 
Where the rate of increase in the dependent variable (y-axis) slows down significantly and approaches a plateau. This typically signifies that the system is reaching its maximum capacity or limit, beyond which further increases in the independent variable (x-axis) have diminishing or negligible effects. It reflects the point at which additional input, growth, or change no longer leads to proportional output due to underlying boundaries in the system.
