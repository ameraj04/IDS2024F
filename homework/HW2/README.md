Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer.   
In computers, everything is ultimately represented by integers because computers are based on digital electronics, which operate on binary systems. The fundamental reason for this lies in the hardware design and the nature of how computers process and store information. a. Binary Representation b. Memory c. Logical and Boolean Operations.  
The fastest part of a computer's memory is called the CPU (Central Processing Unit).   
The slowest storage device in computers is the mechanical hard disk drive (HDD).   
The smallest unit of information in computer science is the bit.  
A. The programming language closest to machine code (i.e., binary code) is assembly language. B. Yes  
The oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use is Fortran. B. Fortran was created in 1957. As of 2024, this makes Fortran approximately 67 years old, which is around 7 decades old.   
A. Assembly B. Fortan, C and C++ are Third Generation Languages. MATLAB, Python and R are Fourth Generation Languages.   
C language : Created in the 1970s (third generation) , C++ and MATLAB Created in the 1980. (third generation) , Python: Created in the 1990s (fourth generation).  
An ancestor programming language of C is B.   
An ancestor programming language of C++ is C.   
Fortran is an ancestor of MATLAB.   
The fastest part of the memory in the memory hierarchy of modern computers is the CPU register.   
The smallest memory unit in the memory hierarchy of modern computers is CPU Register.   
Accessing register memory is significantly faster than accessing RAM in modern computers. About 4 times faster.  
Accessing RAM is significantly faster than accessing typical SSD hard drives in modern computers but SSD hard drives is faster than HDD.   
Accessing RAM is about a little faster than accessing typical HDD (Hard Disk Drive) hard drives in modern computers.   
With the invention of transistors, many scientists and engineers independently proposed and devised alternative architectures (to fixed-program computers) that stored the instructions to act on data along with the data in the memory instead of physically implementing the tasks in the hardware and rewiring the hardware for new tasks. The turning point in the history of computers was the invention of transistors which enabled the development of microchips. On each IC, many transistors act as miniature electrical switches that can turn a current on or off.  
As more transistors are added, the performance improvements become less significant due to factors like increased latency and the responsibility of managing more transistors. More transistors generate more heat. As transistor density increases, effectively managing heat becomes a challenge. 
Fetch, decode and execute.  
Yes. Different CPU architectures can have varying efficiency levels. A CPU with a high number of cycles may be poorly designed or optimized for certain tasks, leading to slower overall performance compared to a simpler, more efficient architecture. A computer with fewer CPU cycles might have a better cache and memory architecture, allowing it to access data more quickly and vice versa.  
Memory access is considered the primary bottleneck of speed, rather than CPU clock speed. Memory access times (latency) are significantly longer than CPU clock cycles. If the CPU frequently has to wait for data to be fetched from memory, it cannot utilize its processing power efficiently.   
Since the early days of invention of transistors, engineers realized that as the transistors get smaller, their power consumption also reduces proportionally, such that the overall Power Density of transistors remains roughly the same. The Dennard Scaling implies that the more transistors we can fit on an Integrated Circuit (IC), typically of size 1 centimeters, the faster the CPU will become. This observation has become known as the Dennard scaling, also known as MOSFET scaling in honor of Robert H. Dennard who was a co-author of a 1974 paper discussing this semi-empirical phenomenon. Short after the discovery of Dennard Scaling, Gordon Moore, the former CEO of Intel, predicted in 1975 that the transistor count in microprocessors will double every two years. This is known as Moore's Law.  
Grains in the last (64th) square: 64 grains. , Total grains for all chessboard squares: 2,080 grains. , Pounds of rice needed: Approximately 0.30 pounds.   
A. 9223372036854775808 B. 18446744073709551616 C. 2635300630386367 D. 1317695317  
Conditional Branching, Manipulation of Arbitary Memory, Ability to perforn Loops.  
Exponential Behavior - will appear as a straight line when both axes are plotted. Power-Law Behavior will also appear as a straight line but it will indicate a slope as well denoting the power (exponent).
