Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer.     
In computers, everything is ultimately represented by integers because computers are based on digital electronics, which operate on binary systems. The fundamental reason for this lies in the hardware design and the nature of how computers process and store information. 1. Binary System (0s and 1s)
Hardware Constraints: Computers are built using transistors, which are tiny electronic switches that can be either "on" or "off." This naturally maps to two states: 0 (off) and 1 (on). Simplicity and Reliability: Using only two states reduces the chance of errors caused by electrical noise or voltage fluctuations. It's easier to distinguish between two states (high or low voltage) than to distinguish between many possible states. Logical Operations: Binary makes it simple to implement basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) that form the foundation of computation. Base-2 (Binary) Arithmetic: All numbers can be represented in binary (base-2) using only 0s and 1s. Computers operate on this system to perform arithmetic and logic operations. Memory and Addressing: Memory addresses are also represented as integers. When a computer fetches data from memory, it references locations (addresses) using integers.

The fastest part of the memory in the memory hierarchy of modern computers is the CPU register.   
The smallest memory unit in the memory hierarchy of modern computers is CPU Register.   
Accessing register memory is significantly faster than accessing RAM in modern computers. About 4 times faster.  
Accessing RAM is significantly faster than accessing typical SSD hard drives in modern computers but SSD hard drives is faster than HDD.   
Accessing RAM is about a little faster than accessing typical HDD (Hard Disk Drive) hard drives in modern computers.   
With the invention of transistors, many scientists and engineers independently proposed and devised alternative architectures (to fixed-program computers) that stored the instructions to act on data along with the data in the memory instead of physically implementing the tasks in the hardware and rewiring the hardware for new tasks. The turning point in the history of computers was the invention of transistors which enabled the development of microchips. On each IC, many transistors act as miniature electrical switches that can turn a current on or off.  
As more transistors are added, the performance improvements become less significant due to factors like increased latency and the responsibility of managing more transistors. More transistors generate more heat. As transistor density increases, effectively managing heat becomes a challenge.   
Fetch, decode and execute. Fetch: Retrieve the instruction from memory. Decode: Interpret the instruction to understand the operation. Execute: Perform the operation as specified by the instruction.  
These tasks occur in a continuous cycle, often referred to as the Fetch-Decode-Execute (FDE) cycle, and are fundamental to the operation of a CPU. Each cycle typically lasts a few nanoseconds, and modern processors use techniques like pipelining to overlap these stages, improving overall performance.
Yes. Different CPU architectures can have varying efficiency levels. A CPU with a high number of cycles may be poorly designed or optimized for certain tasks, leading to slower overall performance compared to a simpler, more efficient architecture. A computer with fewer CPU cycles might have a better cache and memory architecture, allowing it to access data more quickly and vice versa.  
Memory access is considered the primary bottleneck of speed, rather than CPU clock speed. Memory access times (latency) are significantly longer than CPU clock cycles. If the CPU frequently has to wait for data to be fetched from memory, it cannot utilize its processing power efficiently.   
Since the early days of invention of transistors, engineers realized that as the transistors get smaller, their power consumption also reduces proportionally, such that the overall Power Density of transistors remains roughly the same. The Dennard Scaling implies that the more transistors we can fit on an Integrated Circuit (IC), typically of size 1 centimeters, the faster the CPU will become. This observation has become known as the Dennard scaling, also known as MOSFET scaling in honor of Robert H. Dennard who was a co-author of a 1974 paper discussing this semi-empirical phenomenon. Short after the discovery of Dennard Scaling, Gordon Moore, the former CEO of Intel, predicted in 1975 that the transistor count in microprocessors will double every two years. This is known as Moore's Law.
