2. The three desiderata of Probability Theory are:
(I) Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers that means no negative number. 
(II) Qualitative correspondence with common sense.
(III) Consistency.
(I) If a conclusion can be reasoned out in more than one way, then every possible way must lead to the same result.
(II) We must always consider all the evidence relevant to a question. We should not arbitrarily ignore some information, basing the conclusions only on what remains.
(III) We must always represent equivalent states of knowledge by equivalent plausibility assignments. That is, if the state of knowledge is the same (except perhaps for labeling the propositions) in two problems, then it must assign the same plausibilities in both.  

All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We call these features Aesthetics. Some examples are: Colors (used to differentiate between data groups/categories), Shapes (used to differentiate between data groups/categories),  Sizes (can indicate lower/higher values), Position (X and Y coordinates), Line width and Line type (solid, dotted), etc.   

The two types of Aesthetics are: 
1. Positional Aesthetic: Those that can represent continuous data. Continuous data values are values for which arbitrarily fine intermediates exist. These involve the placement of data points in a visual space, typically using the X and Y coordinates (or axes). Positional aesthetics are the primary means of showing relationships and trends between variables.
For example, time duration is a continuous value. Between any two durations, say 60 seconds and 61 seconds, there are arbitrarily many intermediates, such as 60.5 seconds, 60.51 seconds, 60.50001 seconds, and so on. 
2. Non-Positional Aesthetic: These involve visual properties that do not rely on the specific location of the data point but instead use other attributes to convey information.
For example, the number of people in a room is a discrete value. A room can hold 5 people or 6, but not 5.5. Non-positional aesthetics enhance the visualization by adding more dimensions of information, allowing the viewer to interpret additional variables without changing the position of the data points. For example, Color: Different hues to represent categories or gradient colors for continuous values, Size: To indicate magnitude or importance, as seen in bubble charts, Shape: Different symbols or markers to distinguish between groups or categories.

The two major types of data are:
1. Qualitative Data (or Categorical Data)
•	Definition: Qualitative data describes characteristics, categories, or qualities. It is non-numeric and often involves attributes or labels that describe a particular quality or classification.
•	Examples:
o	Nominal Data: Categories without any natural order or ranking. Example: Types of fruits (apple, banana, orange).
o	Ordinal Data: Categories with a natural order or ranking. Example: Customer satisfaction ratings (poor, fair, good, excellent).
2. Quantitative Data (or Numerical Data)
•	Definition: Quantitative data represents numerical values that can be measured or counted. It describes quantities and can be used for arithmetic calculations.
•	Examples:
o	Discrete Data: Countable values, often whole numbers. Example: Number of students in a classroom (e.g., 40 students).
o	Continuous Data: Measurable values that can take any number within a range, often including fractions or decimals. Example: Height of individuals (e.g., 5.8 feet).

Categorical Variables are used to represent data that can be divided into groups or categories. Variables holding qualitative data are known as factors. These variables do not have a numerical value in the usual sense, but rather label or describe an attribute or quality. For example, country, gender, etc. Levels of factors are most commonly without order, but factors can also be ordered.
