The fastest component of a computer memory is CPU (CPU Register).  
To partially address the speed gap between CPU and memory, manufacturers design contemporary computer architectures with a hierarchical memory structure with varying sizes and speeds. This is in contrast to design of memory as a single homogeneous chunk of data storage available to the processor.

Bit is the smallest unit of information.  
Computer hardware relies on the force of electromagnetism to store and process data. Specifically, they use electric voltage and electricity flow or the lack of flow to store and process data as a sequence of 0 and 1. That's why humans utilize binary numbers. Arithmetic block performs arithmetic operations (+, -, â€¦) on the input data (comprised of binary 0 and 1). The input/output of the arithmetic block are held in a special part of computer memory called CPU registers.
