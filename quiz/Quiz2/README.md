The fastest component of a computer memory is CPU (CPU Register).  
To partially address the speed gap between CPU and memory, manufacturers design contemporary computer architectures with a hierarchical memory structure with varying sizes and speeds. This is in contrast to design of memory as a single homogeneous chunk of data storage available to the processor.  
HDD (Disk)  
Resgisters -> L1 cache -> L2 cache -> L3 cache -> DRAM -> Disk  
Bit is the smallest unit of information.  
Computer hardware relies on the force of electromagnetism to store and process data. Specifically, they use electric voltage and electricity flow or the lack of flow to store and process data as a sequence of 0 and 1. That's why humans utilize binary numbers. Arithmetic block performs arithmetic operations (+, -, â€¦) on the input data (comprised of binary 0 and 1). The input/output of the arithmetic block are held in a special part of computer memory called CPU registers.  
Less than 1 nano second.  
It was built in 1940.  
It was built in 1945.  
A kind of computer that had to be rewired to perform a new task.

Imperative knowledge is about how to accomplish something, or basically, is a recipe on how to do something, known as algorithm in scientific terminology. Declarative knowledge is statement/fact.

For Python it is unclear, but ABC seems to be the ancestor. Fortran is the ancestor of MATLAB.  
Logarithm is basically a function that is used to express exponential quantities. For example, if we have a grain of rice in one block, and we have total 60 blocks, and in each block a grain adds up to the existing one... our total calculation will be super long. Therefore, it is efficient to use logarithm function as it is fast and can calculate the quantity in exponents.  
S = 1683 (Summation property).  
The longer lasting memory is Magnetic tapes about 20 years. HDD about 5 years.  

S=10^5050 (Summation and property of exponents).
