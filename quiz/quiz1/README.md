README.md has been created.  
.md means MarkDown. Its a syntax that has its own version in github. It helps to play around the text easier such as bold, italicized, etc. Markdown Formatting: GitHub supports rendering Markdown files. When you name a README file with the .md extension, GitHub automatically recognizes the file as a Markdown file and renders it with proper formatting when viewed on the platform. This means headings, links, lists, and other Markdown syntax are displayed as intended, not just as plain text.  
No, Git does not index or track empty folders in your project. Git only tracks files, not directories. However, it does track the presence of a folder as long as it contains files.     
Yes, Does every Git project have a .git folder.    
The .git folder in Git projects is the core directory where Git stores all the metadata and history needed to manage the repository. It is essentially the brain of the Git version control system for a specific project. The presence of this folder allows Git to track changes, manage commits, store configuration, and handle various other version control operations.  
cd - change directory AKA change to home.    
ls- it lists the directory.    
pwd - shows the current directory.    
a. working directory b. staging directory  c. .git repository    
VCS is basically a way to record the changes in the file or group of files that has been done by an individual or group of people collaborating on the same project overtime. This is helpful to track the changes in the version later.  
a. Each person working on the project has clone of the central repository on their device. b. Each person has a back up of the data. c. Data cannot be loss. d. Can handle large projects with people sharing the data. e. There is less chance of errors. f. Minor/Major changes can be tracked easily so no one gets confused between the different versions.  
a. Local VCS b. Centralized VCS c. Distributed VCS  
Git is a distributed version control software and GitHub is the central remote repository.   
git status lists all new and modified files to be committed.    
git push -all - Stages the modified and deleted files without the newly-created files. It pushes all commits from the local repository to the remote repository, to place them permanently there so that they can be shared to others. 
git pull - It basically pulls the latest updated version from the remote repository to the local repository.  
Markdown is a way to style text on the computer. Basically, it can format the text (bold, italicized etc). It includes text and some non-alphabatical characters such as #,*    
We make the text bold in MarkDown by adding **text**.    
We make the text italic in MarkDown by adding *text*.       
git init  
./ means current, ../ means one time back (previous folder or file from the current one).   
I am able to see the files that I created on README.md folder for my project IDS2024F in DOWNLOADS folder of my computer. DOWNLOADS to IDS2024F to all the folders such as homework, quiz, readme.md etc. I am able to basically push the data from remote repository to the local respository. -rf command illustrates the modification in the data.

Three major modern pillars of science: Experiment, Theory and Computation + Data  
Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Data Management.  
Coding, Stats, and Domain.  
A Data Scientist is someone who analyzes the data on a large scale with the help of Stats, coding, data represenation, data mining and computer algorithms. They are able to make conclusions out of the collected data and describe the trends as well.   
Absolute path is more appropriate to use in github.  
git clone  
cd ~ basically takes us out of the folder we currently be working in.
