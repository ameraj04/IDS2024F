Frequentist Inference.    
Bayesian Inference. Prior knowledge has a fundamental rolein inference along with Data so existence of God involves having prior knowledge taught by elders, Holy books, history, etc. 
Yes, Bayesian Inference a subset of the Frequentist Inference methods. ...  
Bayesian Inference.  
Answer  
It appeared in 1975.  
According to Frequentist Inference: The uncertainty is inherent in the experiment. I cannot reduce uncertainty any further. Therefore, the uncertainty is aleatoric. But according to The uncertainty is due to my lack of knowledge: 1. Wrong / inadequate model. 2. Lack of sufficiently-detailed data which leads to inadequate model. I can reduce uncertainty with better data / model. Therefore, the uncertainty is epistemic.  
Epistemic.  
All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We call these features Aesthetics. Some examples are: Colors (used to differentiate between data groups/categories), Shapes (used to differentiate between data groups/categories), Sizes (can indicate lower/higher values), Position (X and Y coordinates), Line width and Line type (solid, dotted), etc.  
The two types of Aesthetics are: Positional Aesthetic: Those that can represent continuous data. Continuous data values are values for which arbitrarily fine intermediates exist. These involve the placement of data points in a visual space, typically using the X and Y coordinates (or axes). Positional aesthetics are the primary means of showing relationships and trends between variables. For example, time duration is a continuous value. Between any two durations, say 60 seconds and 61 seconds, there are arbitrarily many intermediates, such as 60.5 seconds, 60.51 seconds, 60.50001 seconds, and so on. Non-Positional Aesthetic: These involve visual properties that do not rely on the specific location of the data point but instead use other attributes to convey information. For example, the number of people in a room is a discrete value. A room can hold 5 people or 6, but not 5.5. Non-positional aesthetics enhance the visualization by adding more dimensions of information, allowing the viewer to interpret additional variables without changing the position of the data points. For example, Color: Different hues to represent categories or gradient colors for continuous values, Size: To indicate magnitude or importance, as seen in bubble charts, Shape: Different symbols or markers to distinguish between groups or categories.
When data is numerical, we also call it quantitative and when it is categorical, we call it qualitative. Variables holding qualitative data are factors, and the different categories are called levels. The levels of a factor are most commonly without order (as in the example of “dog”, “cat”, “fish”), but factors can also be ordered, when there is an intrinsic order among the levels of the factor (as in the example of “good, "fair", etc.  
The two major types of data are: Qualitative Data (or Categorical Data) • Definition: Qualitative data describes characteristics, categories, or qualities. It is non-numeric and often involves attributes or labels that describe a particular quality or classification. • Examples: o Nominal Data: Categories without any natural order or ranking. Example: Types of fruits (apple, banana, orange). o Ordinal Data: Categories with a natural order or ranking. Example: Customer satisfaction ratings (poor, fair, good, excellent). Quantitative Data (or Numerical Data) • Definition: Quantitative data represents numerical values that can be measured or counted. It describes quantities and can be used for arithmetic calculations. • Examples: o Discrete Data: Countable values, often whole numbers. Example: Number of students in a classroom (e.g., 40 students). o Continuous Data: Measurable values that can take any number within a range, often including fractions or decimals. Example: Height of individuals (e.g., 5.8 feet).  
The common name for variables holding data is Factors.  
Ordered Data (Ordinal Data) • This type of data has a meaningful order or ranking, but the differences between the values are not necessarily uniform or measurable. There is a clear sequence or rank, but the exact difference between the levels may not be defined. • Examples: o Education Levels: High school < Bachelor's < Master's < Doctorate o Customer Satisfaction Ratings: Poor < Fair < Good < Excellent. Unordered Data (Nominal Data) • This type of data consists of categories without any inherent order or ranking. : The categories are distinct, but there is no logical sequence or ranking among them. • Examples: o Types of Fruits: Apple, Banana, Orange, Mango o Countries: USA, Canada, Japan, Australia.  
1.Qualitative Color Scale :means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map. 2.Represent data values (sequential): Gradual transitions between colors, often moving from light to dark or one hue to another. Best Usage: For ordered data with a natural progression, such as temperature, elevation, or time. 3.Represent data values (diverging): Two contrasting colors diverging from a neutral midpoint. Best Usage: For data with a meaningful midpoint, such as deviations from an average, zero, or target value 4.Highlight: Distinct, contrasting colors to represent discrete, unordered categories. Best Usage: For categorical or nominal data, such as different countries, brands, or species.  
They avoid 3D plots in their visualization because it makes the data very confusing.  
Ans (19 and 20).  
Color is a categorical/unordered aesthetic.  
All three coordinate systems—Cartesian, curvilinear, and polar—are valid for representing data. The choice of the system depends on the type of data and the most intuitive way to visualize or analyze it: a.	Cartesian Coordinates (Rectangular grid, black): Typically used for data with linear relationships or structured grids (e.g., height vs. weight). This is a valid coordinate system. o	Example: Plotting points (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) in a 2D space. b.	Curved Grid (blue): Useful when the data or the domain naturally follows curves or warped geometries. No matter how you combine movements aling b1 and b2, you will always be stuck on the curves, you cannot reach every point on the grid. Therefore, this is not a valid coordinate system. Example: Representing airflow over an airplane wing. 3.	Skewed Grid (red): This one has slanted points but they can still reach every point in the grid. Therefore, this is a valid coordinate system.  
The color palette transitioning from purple to green, passing through white is more effective for visualization than the red-to-green palette in many cases, particularly because it provides better contrast and is more inclusive for individuals with color vision deficiencies. The magenta-to-green palette is more distinguishable for individuals with red-green color blindness because magenta provides sufficient contrast compared to green. This palette works well for diverging data, where you need to show deviations from a neutral midpoint (represented by white in this case). For example: Showing changes above and below an average or baseline. Magenta and green are positioned on opposite sides of the color wheel, making them visually distinct and easy to differentiate even for humans.
