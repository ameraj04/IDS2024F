I can reduce uncertainty with better data / model. Therefore, the uncertainty is epistemic.  
Epistemic.  
All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We call these features Aesthetics. Some examples are: Colors (used to differentiate between data groups/categories), Shapes (used to differentiate between data groups/categories), Sizes (can indicate lower/higher values), Position (X and Y coordinates), Line width and Line type (solid, dotted), etc.
