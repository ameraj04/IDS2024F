Answer 1.  
Answer 2.  
Bayesian Inference.    
Frequentist Inference.    
Bayesian Inference. Prior knowledge has a fundamental rolein inference along with Data so existence of God involves having prior knowledge taught by elders, Holy books, history, etc. 
Yes, Bayesian Inference a subset of the Frequentist Inference methods. ...  
Bayesian Inference.  
Answer  
It appeared in 1975.  
According to Frequentist Inference: The uncertainty is inherent in the experiment. I cannot reduce uncertainty any further. Therefore, the uncertainty is aleatoric. But according to The uncertainty is due to my lack of knowledge: 1. Wrong / inadequate model. 2. Lack of sufficiently-detailed data which leads to inadequate model. I can reduce uncertainty with better data / model. Therefore, the uncertainty is epistemic.  
Epistemic.  
All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We call these features Aesthetics. Some examples are: Colors (used to differentiate between data groups/categories), Shapes (used to differentiate between data groups/categories), Sizes (can indicate lower/higher values), Position (X and Y coordinates), Line width and Line type (solid, dotted), etc.  
The two types of Aesthetics are: Positional Aesthetic: Those that can represent continuous data. Continuous data values are values for which arbitrarily fine intermediates exist. These involve the placement of data points in a visual space, typically using the X and Y coordinates (or axes). Positional aesthetics are the primary means of showing relationships and trends between variables. For example, time duration is a continuous value. Between any two durations, say 60 seconds and 61 seconds, there are arbitrarily many intermediates, such as 60.5 seconds, 60.51 seconds, 60.50001 seconds, and so on. Non-Positional Aesthetic: These involve visual properties that do not rely on the specific location of the data point but instead use other attributes to convey information. For example, the number of people in a room is a discrete value. A room can hold 5 people or 6, but not 5.5. Non-positional aesthetics enhance the visualization by adding more dimensions of information, allowing the viewer to interpret additional variables without changing the position of the data points. For example, Color: Different hues to represent categories or gradient colors for continuous values, Size: To indicate magnitude or importance, as seen in bubble charts, Shape: Different symbols or markers to distinguish between groups or categories.
