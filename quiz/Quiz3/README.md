The steps involved in Scientific Inference are:   
The Three Pillars of Science are: Experiment, Theory and Computation/Simulation.    

The two types of scientific reasonings are: a. Deductive: This type of reasoning is a statement that can be either true or false. It has to be one only and cannot be both. Premise 1: All fruits contain seeds. Premise 2: An apple is a fruit. Conclusion: Therefore, an apple is a fruit. b. Plausible: When conclusions are reached using data or observations that point to a likely or probable outcome rather than offering complete assurance, this is known as plausible reasoning. It entails drawing conclusions or generalizations from particular cases, experiences, or trends; these conclusions are plausible and reasonable, but they are not always accurate. Plausible reasoning addresses uncertainty and seeks to determine the most likely or reasonable answer given the evidence at hand, in contrast to deductive reasoning, which provides logically certain conclusions. Observation 1: I usually go to gym on weekdays. Observation 2: Today is a weekday. Conclusion: I will probably go to a gym today.  
The difference between data and reality is that reality is a natural phenomena. It is independent of any measurements or observations. Observational Data is information that is collected through measurements, observations, etc. Observational data can be influenced by factors such as limited use of tool/technology, bias in data or measurement errors whereas, reality is not affected by these limitations. Interpreting observational data is frequently necessary to determine what it suggests about reality. Different interpretations can arise from the same data, while reality remains constant. In essence, observational data is an approximation or a model of reality, rather than a perfect representation. It can help us understand aspects of reality, but it is always subject to limitations and uncertainties. We can definitely observe reality.   
The difference between model validation vs caliberation is that
"Let A be "The class begins." "Let B be "It is 9 AM." The logical implication Aâ‡’B can be interpreted as: "If the class starts, then it is 9 AM." This might be a true statement in some contexts (e.g., if the class is set to begin at 9 AM), but it does not mean that the act of the class beginning causes the time to be 9 AM. In this case, while the implication holds true if the class starts at 9 AM, it does not mean that the class itself is responsible for the time being 9 AM. The class is just a signal indicating that it is time; the actual passage of time is an independent process. This example demonstrates that logical implications can exist without establishing a causal relationship between the two statements. The relationship may hold true logically, but it does not imply that one event causes the other in a physical sense.  
The Boolean algebra is named after George Boole.  
Done.  
Done.  
If two Boolean propositions are equal then it means that the proposition on the left-hand side has the same truth value as the proposition on the right-hand side. It denotes two equal truth value.  

 
Done.  
The tiniest unit of information is a Bit.  
Yes, this universe would still contain information.  
With 4 bits of information, I can represent 16 integers.  
I can represent 38 decimal integers with 4 boxes.
