The steps involved in Scientific Inference are: Observation, hypothesis, prediction, experiment, results and analysis. Peer Evaluation comes at the end. Observation basically involves observing a natural phenomena/interest/subject. Hypothesis is developing a tentative idea/explanation based on observations. Prediction is making predictions based on hypothesis and then through experimentation test them out to draw conclusions. 

The Three Pillars of Science are: Experiment, Theory and Computation/Simulation.    

Three different applications of Simulation pillar is based on computational techniques/models blended with theory, experiments and implementation.       a. Bioinformatics/Genomics/Genetics: Computational and Data Sciences can help with the collection and analyzation of data about DNA sequences, etc to understand the molecular structures. b. Healthcare & Medical Imaging: Machine algorithms and models can help with the medical imagings such as MRI, CT scans etc to study the trend of disease and optimize the treatment. c. Astronomy & Astrophysics: Computational models and techniques assist with data collection of telescopes and space stuff such as formation of galaxies, etc. In these applications, computational science not only improves theoretical and experimental science's capabilities but also provides novel ways to tackle challenging issues, evaluate enormous datasets, and streamline research procedures.  

The two types of scientific reasonings are: a. Deductive: This type of reasoning is a statement that can be either true or false. It has to be one only and cannot be both. Premise 1: All fruits contain seeds. Premise 2: An apple is a fruit. Conclusion: Therefore, an apple is a fruit. b. Plausible: When conclusions are reached using data or observations that point to a likely or probable outcome rather than offering complete assurance, this is known as plausible reasoning. It entails drawing conclusions or generalizations from particular cases, experiences, or trends; these conclusions are plausible and reasonable, but they are not always accurate. Plausible reasoning addresses uncertainty and seeks to determine the most likely or reasonable answer given the evidence at hand, in contrast to deductive reasoning, which provides logically certain conclusions. Observation 1: I usually go to gym on weekdays. Observation 2: Today is a weekday. Conclusion: I will probably go to a gym today. 

The difference between data and reality is that reality is a natural phenomena. It is independent of any measurements or observations. Observational Data is information that is collected through measurements, observations, etc. Observational data can be influenced by factors such as limited use of tool/technology, bias in data or measurement errors whereas, reality is not affected by these limitations. Interpreting observational data is frequently necessary to determine what it suggests about reality. Different interpretations can arise from the same data, while reality remains constant. In essence, observational data is an approximation or a model of reality, rather than a perfect representation. It can help us understand aspects of reality, but it is always subject to limitations and uncertainties. We can definitely observe reality. 

The difference between model validation vs caliberation is that: The process of modifying model parameters to increase the degree of agreement between the model's predictions and the observed data is known as Calibration. For example, caliberating the instrument/tool correctly increases the chance of finding data with more accuracy. Whereas the process of evaluating a model's correctness by comparing its predictions to independent data that wasn't used during the calibration stage is called validation. Its utilized more for generalizing for example generalizing to unseen data, or to new data to see its accuracy.  

"Let A be "The class begins." "Let B be "It is 9 AM." The logical implication A⇒B can be interpreted as: "If the class starts, then it is 9 AM." This might be a true statement in some contexts (e.g., if the class is set to begin at 9 AM), but it does not mean that the act of the class beginning causes the time to be 9 AM. In this case, while the implication holds true if the class starts at 9 AM, it does not mean that the class itself is responsible for the time being 9 AM. The class is just a signal indicating that it is time; the actual passage of time is an independent process. This example demonstrates that logical implications can exist without establishing a causal relationship between the two statements. The relationship may hold true logically, but it does not imply that one event causes the other in a physical sense.

The Boolean algebra is named after George Boole.

Done. The Venn diagram above represents the logical product or conjunction. The shaded region corresponds to the intersection where both A and B are true. This indicates that this is true only when both propositions A and B are true simultaneously.  

Done. The Venn diagram above represents the logical sum or disjunction A+B. The shaded regions include the area where A is true, the area where B is true, and the area where both A and B are true. This indicates that A+B is true if at least one of the propositions A or B is true, or if both are true.  

If two Boolean propositions are equal then it means that the proposition on the left-hand side has the same truth value as the proposition on the right-hand side. It denotes two equal truth value. 

When two propositions complement each other, their sum is always true. For example A = The light is on. A complement = The light is off. This statement is always true because the light can either be on or off, but there is no third option.  

The result of multiplying two complementary propositions is always false. For example, A = The water bottle is empty. B complement = The water bottle is full. This statement is always false because the water glass cannot be empty and full at the sametime.  
 
Done. To represent the logical implication A⇒B using a Venn Diagram, we need to show that whenever A is true, B is also true. In a Venn Diagram, this means that the area representing A should be entirely within the area representing B.  

The tiniest unit of information is a Bit.  

No, universe won't contain any information. In a completely empty universe, there are no entities/particles to represent any data. Thus, if we consider bits as units of information, an empty universe would have no bits to convey any information. The information/observational data would be empty.  

With 4 bits of information, I can represent 16 integers. As each bit has two possible values 0 or 1. 

I can represent 81 decimal integers with 4 boxes.
