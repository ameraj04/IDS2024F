1. Data is what we observe. Reality is what we never observed because it is always obfuscated with noise. The difference between data and reality is that reality is a natural phenomena. It is independent of any measurements or observations. Observational Data is information that is collected through measurements, observations, etc. Observational data can be influenced by factors such as limited use of tool/technology, bias in data or measurement errors whereas, reality is not affected by these limitations. Interpreting observational data is frequently necessary to determine what it suggests about reality. Different interpretations can arise from the same data, while reality remains constant. In essence, observational data is an approximation or a model of reality, rather than a perfect representation. It can help us understand aspects of reality, but it is always subject to limitations and uncertainties. We can definitely observe reality.
2. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We call these features Aesthetics. Some examples are: Colors (used to differentiate between data groups/categories), Shapes (used to differentiate between data groups/categories), Sizes (can indicate lower/higher values), Position (X and Y coordinates), Line width and Line type (solid, dotted), etc. The two types of Aesthetics are:
Positional Aesthetic: Those that can represent continuous data. Continuous data values are values for which arbitrarily fine intermediates exist. These involve the placement of data points in a visual space, typically using the X and Y coordinates (or axes). Positional aesthetics are the primary means of showing relationships and trends between variables. For example, time duration is a continuous value. Between any two durations, say 60 seconds and 61 seconds, there are arbitrarily many intermediates, such as 60.5 seconds, 60.51 seconds, 60.50001 seconds, and so on.
Non-Positional Aesthetic: These involve visual properties that do not rely on the specific location of the data point but instead use other attributes to convey information. For example, the number of people in a room is a discrete value. A room can hold 5 people or 6, but not 5.5. Non-positional aesthetics enhance the visualization by adding more dimensions of information, allowing the viewer to interpret additional variables without changing the position of the data points. For example, Color: Different hues to represent categories or gradient colors for continuous values, Size: To indicate magnitude or importance, as seen in bubble charts, Shape: Different symbols or markers to distinguish between groups or categories.  
3. The color palette transitioning from pink/magenta to green, passing through white is more effective for visualization than the red-to-green palette in many cases, particularly because it provides better contrast and is more inclusive for individuals with color vision deficiencies. The magenta-to-green palette is more distinguishable for individuals with red-green color blindness because magenta provides sufficient contrast compared to green. This palette works well for diverging data, where you need to show deviations from a neutral midpoint (represented by white in this case). For example: Showing changes above and below an average or baseline. Magenta and green are positioned on opposite sides of the color wheel, making them visually distinct and easy to differentiate even for humans.

7. No. "Let A be "The class begins." "Let B be "It is 9 AM." The logical implication Aâ‡’B can be interpreted as: "If the class starts, then it is 9 AM." This might be a true statement in some contexts (e.g., if the class is set to begin at 9 AM), but it does not mean that the act of the class beginning causes the time to be 9 AM. In this case, while the implication holds true if the class starts at 9 AM, it does not mean that the class itself is responsible for the time being 9 AM. The class is just a signal indicating that it is time; the actual passage of time is an independent process. This example demonstrates that logical implications can exist without establishing a causal relationship between the two statements. The relationship may hold true logically, but it does not imply that one event causes the other in a physical sense.
8. No, this is visually not a good fit in my opinion because it does not show any trend. xx

17. Frequentist Inference. It treats probability as the long-run frequency of events. No prior knowledge is utilized.
