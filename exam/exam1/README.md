1. Data is what we observe. Reality is what we never observed because it is always obfuscated with noise. The difference between data and reality is that reality is a natural phenomena. It is independent of any measurements or observations. Observational Data is information that is collected through measurements, observations, etc. Observational data can be influenced by factors such as limited use of tool/technology, bias in data or measurement errors whereas, reality is not affected by these limitations. Interpreting observational data is frequently necessary to determine what it suggests about reality. Different interpretations can arise from the same data, while reality remains constant. In essence, observational data is an approximation or a model of reality, rather than a perfect representation. It can help us understand aspects of reality, but it is always subject to limitations and uncertainties. We can definitely observe reality.  
2. The color palette transitioning from pink/magenta to green, passing through white is more effective for visualization than the red-to-green palette in many cases, particularly because it provides better contrast and is more inclusive for individuals with color vision deficiencies. The magenta-to-green palette is more distinguishable for individuals with red-green color blindness because magenta provides sufficient contrast compared to green. This palette works well for diverging data, where you need to show deviations from a neutral midpoint (represented by white in this case). For example: Showing changes above and below an average or baseline. Magenta and green are positioned on opposite sides of the color wheel, making them visually distinct and easy to differentiate even for humans.
